### **Operation**

After completing the assembly of the CP \- RPS, line testing ensures the functionality, reliability, and safety of the product. Follow the steps below to conduct a thorough line test:

#### **1\. Visual Inspection**

* Verify that all components are securely fastened, including the **AC-DC Module**, **DC-DC Module**, and **Banana Jack Sockets**.  
* Ensure all wiring connections are made as per the provided diagrams, with no loose or exposed wires.  
* Confirm that the ventilation slots and fan are unobstructed to allow proper airflow.

#### **2\. Short Circuit Check**

* Before powering on the device, use a multimeter in continuity mode to check for any unintended short circuits across:  
  * **Line and Neutral terminals** of the **AC-DC Module**.  
  * Output terminals of the **DC-DC Module** and **Banana Jack Sockets**.  
  * Connections to the **Volt-Amp Meter** and other components.

#### **3\. Continuity Test**

* Use a multimeter to check continuity for the following connections:  
  * **Line and Neutral Wires**: Ensure proper connection to the **AC-DC Module**.  
  * **Banana Jack Sockets**: Verify correct wiring from the **DC-DC Module**.  
  * **Volt-Amp Meter**: Ensure the connection is as per the wiring diagram.

#### **4\. Power-On Testing**

* Plug the device into an AC mains supply (230V).  
* Turn on the power switch and observe the following:  
  * The fan starts operating.  
  * The Volt-Amp Meter displays initial readings.  
* Ensure there are no unusual sounds, excessive heat, or visible sparks.

#### **5\. Output Voltage and Current Testing**

* Adjust the potentiometer on the **LDO Module** to set the desired voltage and current.  
* Measure the output at the **Banana Jack Sockets** using a multimeter.  
* Confirm that the voltage and current match the expected values for both **Constant Voltage (CV)** and **Constant Current (CC)** modes.
