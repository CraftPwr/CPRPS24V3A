**Safety Instructions**  
**General Precautions**

* Always disconnect the power supply from the AC mains before performing assembly, maintenance, or component replacement.  
* Ensure the device is properly grounded via the IEC connectorâ€™s Earth (E) terminal to prevent electric shock.  
* Avoid operating the unit in wet, humid, or conductive environments.

**High-Voltage Handling**

* The AC-DC Module operates at 230V AC. Only trained personnel should handle live circuits.  
* Use insulated tools and wear protective gloves when working on high-voltage sections.  
* Verify all AC wiring (Line, Neutral, Earth) is securely connected and insulated before powering the unit.

**Component Handling**

* Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) Precautions:  
* Use ESD-safe workstations, wrist straps, and mats when handling sensitive components (e.g., ICs like LT3081ER\_PBF, LT8612EUDE\#PBF).  
* Store ICs and transistors (e.g., MMBT3906, FMMT493) in anti-static packaging.  
* Avoid mechanical stress on surface-mount components (e.g., 0805/1210 resistors, capacitors).

**Thermal Safety**

* The DC-DC Converter and LDO modules may generate heat during operation.  
* Ensure the 30mm cooling fan is functional and unobstructed.  
* Do not block ventilation slots on the metal enclosure.

**Fuse Replacement**

* Replace the fuse only with the specified rating (see production document).  
* Never bypass the fuse or use a higher-rated fuse, as this compromises overload protection.

**Testing and Debugging**

* Use a multimeter to confirm no short circuits between power rails (e.g., \+36V, \-5V, GND) before initial power-up.  
* During load testing, ensure output terminals (Banana Jack Sockets) are not accidentally shorted.  
* Monitor the Volt-Amp Meter for abnormal readings (e.g., sudden voltage drops or current spikes).

**Compliance and Certification**

* Assemble the unit in compliance with regional electrical safety standards (e.g., IEC 61010, UL 61010-1).  
* Verify all protective earth connections and insulation resistance before final packaging.

**Emergency Procedures**

* In case of smoke, sparks, or unusual odors:  
  * Immediately disconnect the power supply.  
  * Do not attempt repairs while the unit is energized.  
* Keep a Class C fire extinguisher nearby for electrical fires.

**User Training**

* Personnel involved in assembly/testing must be trained in:  
  * Basic electrical safety protocols.  
  * Proper use of multimeters, oscilloscopes, and load testers.  
  * Emergency shutdown procedures.
